A short recording of IQ data from a monostatic radar is provided in the SigMF format. The transmitted waveform is in channel 1 and the received waveform is in channel 2. Compute the radar ambiguity function and find the target delay (in bins) and Doppler (in Hz). Enter the flag as `flag{delay,doppler}`.
